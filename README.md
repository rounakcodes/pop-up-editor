### Task

The task is to build a basic and simple popup editor based on the design in this Figma link. The popup editor should be based on the Figma link, the end user should be able to customize the design

You're tested on:
UI - should look very good. Build an app that looks great and can be easily used by the user
The code should be well-structured and organized, and you should make sure it works in production
Sending the results on time (or asking for more time if needed and showing the progress)

Here are the detailed instructions:
You should use the design in the Figma link as your default popup template and insert it into a web page that will include a drag & drop editor. Please use the Figma design as the default HTML template for the popup editor (when users open the UI, they should see the design you see in the Figma link)

We should be able to drag elements (text, field, button, stars) using the editor to any place they want inside the editing space, not just change order.
Users should be able to add and remove new elements like text, buttons, images and also change the background of the popup (from red to any color), and edit texts

Add an option to save the changes - 'Save' button + 'Preview' button

The 'Save' button will save the existing design either to a DB or you can use local storage as well, whatever you prefer

The popup that will show up should be responsive (scale down on mobile devices)

Add css3 entry effect on popup preview and when popup loads in preview
We should get the source code (can be in GitHub, for example), the Production link, and a 3-5 minute video explaining how and why you built it the way you did. There is no need to explain the UI, just the code itself

It should be built on VueJS, JS, HTML, CSS
Please make the editor and UI as sexy as you can :)
